# Innovaccer_Assignment
 Assignment for Innovaccer

 I have made an Android app using Flutter for this Assignment. The features of my app are as below:

 Any Visitor enterinig Innovaccer facility would be required to provide 6 details :
    His/Her Name, Email, Phone Number
    The Host's(Person whom he/she has come to meet) Name, Email and Phone Number

After providing these details there is a button "Generate Entry" which will lead to final checking of various fields.
 In this there would be shown details of the visitor and the host and also the entry ID and a "QR Code" of this entry.
 An option of sending emails and messages will send respective emails and messages to the host and visitor.

 The tab of Exit will have an option of scanning a QR code which the visitor need to show the person using this app, from which the visitor's exit will be granted and then a mail to visitor containing the details of his/her visit will be sent.

 In my application, the mails are sent through G-Mail, i.e., when the user using this app will click on the option to send mail, it will redirect to G-Mail app but all the fields like Reciepient, Subject, Body, Attachments(if any) would be automatically filled, the user only needs to tap on the send button. 

 The above payload in time could be overcomed, as I wasn't able to get a free Server that would work with flutter, but this problem could be overcomed.
 => You could find the final apk to installed in android from: Innovaccer_Assignment\build\app\outputs\apk\release
